          Watched the first week's video of Financial Peace University with some
          friends.

        Ending a sprint and trying to finish up work meant less time spent on my
        own pursuits. But I did have some friends over and we are all going
        through Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University program. It isn't the
        most optimal way to tackle debt or leverage money, but it teaches some
        great skills. I went through the program three years ago, but I did not
        follow it strictly. I chose to debt avalanche to pay off loans earning
        high interest while student loans have been paused. I got rid of one
        car, but was not successful in convincing the family to downgrade the
        other car to a beater. We got a house before we paid off all our debt
        (only student loan debt remains though, which has been on hold). The
        program helped me a lot still, and because I am still working to pay of
        the last of the student loans (about ~25k), I am going to work through
        the program again. This time with some friends who will hold each other
        accountable.
