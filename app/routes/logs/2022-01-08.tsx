        Lots of time spent reading today. And in the process found about thirty
        new books to read ðŸ˜…. Really enjoying swyx's book, it has branched off
        into so many topics that I want to take a deeper dive on.

        One of the concepts in the book encourages the reader to learn in
        public. This has terrified me for a long time. I have always felt like
        if I showed what I was learning in public, people would look down on me
        for how little I knew, or would think that I wasn't a competent
        developer. I remember when Dan Abramov posted{" "}

        . I admired his courage to be so vulnerable as a thought leader in our
        community with way more reputation to lose. And yet, I still did not
        feel empowered to do the same. In fact, I remember a principal engineer
        I worked with mocking him on Slack and musing about how someone who knew
        so little could get hired at Facebook. I am no longer scared though. A
        mixture of time, experience, and seeing others be courageous without it
        hurting their careers has bolstered my confidence.

        , I am working to build a habit to write daily. I have no aspiration to
        be glamorous. If it sticks I may invest some time making this web log
        nicer. I certainly have so many ideas to make it fun, but I don't want
        to be another built my shiny new personal log folks who never end up
        writing. So here is to 2022 and beyond!
