        Decided to start this up again. I think last time I got too busy with
        work and because I can't talk much about it the daily log didn't make
        sense. I will probably reserve logs for days I feel I have something to
        say, or on weekends when I have more free time.

        For fun, these were the things I wanted to do today instead of what I
        listed above:
        <ul>
          <li>Play and maybe finish Lost Judgement</li>
          <li>
            Play Stardew Valley (picked up again over winter break, in Year 1
            Fall, Day 28)
          </li>
          <li>Advent of Code puzzles</li>
          <li>Watch Football</li>
          <li>Go to the gym</li>
          <li>Read Path of Daggers (Wheel of Time series)</li>
          <li>Sleep longer</li>
        </ul>
        It was a struggle to decide and prioritize, if only there were more time
        in the day, or I had a{" "}
