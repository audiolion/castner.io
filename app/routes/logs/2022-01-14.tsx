          Had a good day finishing out my current sprint retro before a long
          weekend.
        </li>
        <li>Booster had me running a slight fever, but ibuprofen broke it.</li>
        <li>Had dinner with some friends!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I suppose this is my first "zero" day. Besides a lot of coding for work,
        I didn't get anything done outside of that. But I have no illusions that
        every day will be productive, and that is ok. In all things balance.
        Till tomorrow.
