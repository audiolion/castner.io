          Had a lovely day of noodling with flaky tests that only presented in
          the CI environment.

        I am still loving Why We Sleep. Did you know that birds have the ability
        to put only one half of their brains to sleep? And that birds will sit
        in a line to sleep, with the two birds on the ends each shutting down
        one half of their brains and leaving the other half awake to watch the
        group? The rest of the group sleeps both sides of their brain. In the
        middle of the night the birds guarding the ends of the line will get up
        and swap places so they can rest the other side of their brain! This is
        just one small nugget of amazing information in the book. But mostly, it
        is helping me embrace sleep as a superpower, rather than viewing it as a
        colossal waste of time.
