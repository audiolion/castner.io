        Busy day! Ended up doing 90 minutes of workouts today. I am wiped. And
        super dehydrated! Downing a protein shake now after finishing an hour
        long kickboxing workout. I think I am going to sleep well tonight. I was
        able to finish Crucial Conversations today while driving to and picking
        up Peach üçë from doggy daycare.

        and it was causing an issue in one of Sirona's tests. The real issue is

        is debt that you may not want to address because the code <em>works</em>
        . It has been running in production for a long time, it has had months
        or years of bug fixes for edge cases that customers have reported.
        Replacing this tech debt is risky, because the new code, while it may be
        more testable and maintainable, has not seen the same rigor applied to
        it. Therefore it is prudent to keep some debt around until that debt is
        preventing you from extending features in your system for your users or
        it finally is costing too much. In this case, it cost a single developer
        half a day banging against it to make it work with the updated library.
        A rewrite would have taken at least a week. At least this time, it was
        prudent debt to keep.
