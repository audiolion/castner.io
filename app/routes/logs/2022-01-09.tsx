        Sunday's are always very busy days for my family. My wife is a worship
        director for our church, so that means our day starts early, 5:30am, and
        we get back home around 12pm. I mix sound and make sure the broadcast
        goes smoothly. This Sunday, I also started as a YTH group leader, it
        pushes me out of my comfort zone working with teens as they build
        relationships and learn about Christianity.

        for the better part of a year now, and Football was also on today. But
        life is about choices and for now I am really focusing on my career and
        my fitness. I made it to 10,000 steps today, it was the first day above
        30Â° F and got outside for a nice long walk with Peach. And at YTH night
        I got to play about 30 minutes of basketball. I have been playing{" "}

        to encourage me to walk more, with the goal of 10,000 a day. I also am
        doing a 5-week bootcamp starting tomorrow through a local small business
        that does personal training. This will be VoDs because I am trying to
        minimize my social contact. I am somewhat concerned about long covid
        symptoms. When I got mono at 20, it was pretty mild, but my energy was
        gone for the better part of 6 months. And I was at my athletic peak,
        working out daily and pursuing body building at the time. A similar
        outcome would be crushing :(.
